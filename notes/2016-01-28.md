# First skype meeting notes

- Datasets? What are good search terms?
    - for pubmed?
        - MeSH terms (ask librarians...)
        - Comp bio publications may not use term "computational biology"
        - Restricting to individual journals may not be reflective
            - Will miss many pubs in more general journals
            - Open to criticism re: impact factor
    - for github?
- Comparisons
    - comp bio vs all bio
    - publications vs github (broad)
    - specific project pub vs code
        - Maybe restrict to single journal for easier parsing (PLoS Comp Bio?)
    - address issue of impact by comparing comp bio journals and assessing effects of impact?
